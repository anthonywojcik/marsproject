GIT Cheat Sheet

To remove a local branch:
git branch -d the_local_branch

To remove a remote branch:
git push origin --delete <branchName>
or
git push origin :<branchName>

To remove one or more files that have been deleted
git add -u .

To push a branch with changes to a remote repo
git push -u origin <branchName>

To check your origin and upstream repo URLs
git remote -vgit 

To add upstream repo so that you can receive changes from there
git remote add upstream <Clone repo URL from repo owner>

Syncing a fork - to keep up to date with the upstream repo (The repo owner's code)
https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork
git fetch upstream
git checkout master (only if you are not in the master branch)
git merge upstream/master (Updates will reflect your local repo only)
git push (so that your fork copy online repo is updated as well)

How to add remote branches to your git local copy
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/67699/how-to-clone-all-remote-branches-with-git?rq=1
git branch -a  <-- To see all remote branches in red that are hidden
git checkout origin(or upstream)/<branch name> <-- To take a look at what the branch has but no changes will be applied
git checkout -b <branch name> origin(or upstream)<branch name>  <-- to actually copy the branch and be able to work on it.
git push -u origin <branchName>   <-- to get the branch up to your forked copy as well.

Update your local repo with your online repo
git pull origin  or git pull origin master
